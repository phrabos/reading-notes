# From the Duckett HTML book:

## HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. 
    - the box will either be block-level
    - or inline
- if one block-level element sits inside another, the outer box is the containing or parent element
- flex layout gets applied to children elements
    - flex direction can be reversed with `flex-direction: column`
- I learned this new CSS trick using `margin-lef: auto` while will push an element to the end of the container
- positioning schemes
    1) normal flow
    2) relative positioning
        - moves element relative to where it would have been by using top, bottom, left and right
    3) absolute positioning
    4) fixed positioning
     - used to assign a specific place on the page the element should go.
    5) floating elements
- z-index similar to "bring to front" or "send to back" feature
- the more I learn how to use CSS the less I hate it.
