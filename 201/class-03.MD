# From the Duckett JS book:

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

- the switch statement first takes a variable. That variable is then compared to different cases. If the variable matches the case, then the code on curly brackets runs. If the variable does not match any of the cases, then the default code is run.
- JavaScript will try to convert data to complete its operation, this is known as type coersion and can lead to unexpected values and errors.
- truthy/falsy every value in JavaScript can be treated as true or false
    - all strings are true, except empty strings, even "false" returns true
- loops
    - for
    - while
    - do while

    ``for (let i = 0, i < array.length, i++){
        run this code each time through the loop
    }``
