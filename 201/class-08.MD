- prior to HTML5 there was not a good solution for storing data on the user-side
- local storage is based on key/value pairs
- set data into local storage with ``localStorage.setItem('KEY_NAME', value)``
- get data from local storage with ``localStorage.getItem('KEY_NAME')``
- the limit to local storage is between 5MB - 10MB
- local storage can be used to track moves in a game
- JSON.stringify & JSON.parse are important steps when setting or getting local storage
- there is something called Indexed Database API that might not be used any longer, as this article is from 2011
