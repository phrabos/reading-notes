Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device adn every screen. The site should work on any screen size. Flexible layouts is the process of building flexible grids capable of resizing to any width. Media queries are used to determine the height or width for a device or browser viewport. One popular to begin web design is to use the mobile first approach, which is desiging the site to fit on a mobile device at first. Viewport height and viewport width are useful for rendering the page to fit the device's screen size.
Float is CSS positioning property. Float can be used instead of absolute to more dynamically layout a webpage. Float can be cleared which creates behavior similar to a line break. I think using flex can be a better way to achieve the same results as floats. The more I read about floats the more it makes me hate CSS.
Grids can be resized dynamiclly by using % as size. Using box sizing is helpful for sizing grid columns/rows. Using modules to setup grid can make it easy to select and size specific webpage elements.
