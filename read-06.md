node.js is simply a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers without the need for a browser. It runs on the same 'engine' that Chrome browsers run on but with added APIs, libraries and other utilities. It seems like node.js will be doing a lot of thing same things we do with JavaScript but it will be running on a server. Node.js is beneficial for running apps that rely on real-time updates to a server like a chat app or a streaming service.
