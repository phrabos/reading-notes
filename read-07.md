This was an interesting way of explaining what REST is and the history of HTTP. I don't really understand what the article is explaining. HTTP is used for getting data like webpages, the images and all other components on the web page. 
The section on API keys got me looking at all the free API resources out there to  use for project ideas. The NASA API seems popular and can make some really cool pages with it. 
Super Agent is an API to help make it easier to make API calls. There is a request object with different methods within that object. You can call the request methods to get data from external API calls. It looks like we will be using "get" and "set" to retrieve data and store it to a variable. Based on the documentation, it looks like Super Agent has a method to handle most scenarios when making API calls.
