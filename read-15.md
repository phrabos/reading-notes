One thing the stood out to me about the diversity in tech statistics was how similar they stats were across several tech companies. I was surprised to see that Amazon was one of the most diverse comanies listed. I did not realize the percent of asian population working at large tech companies was above 30-40%.
It was interesting to read NPR's hypothesis about why women in computer science declined beginning in the mid-80 was due to marketing of the PC being focused on males. I don't remember advertisements for computers being gender specific, but that is more likely due to my bias. The more diverse a workplace can be, the more perspectives people will have at solving problems in different and unique ways.
